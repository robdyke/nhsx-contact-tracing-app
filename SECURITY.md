## Analysing the Solution

Please remember that you will be bound by relevant local and international legislation in how you interact the application and backend systems. In particular, please familiarise yourself with the Computer Misuse Act which can be found at:

This is particularly relevant when interacting with any backend services which are not running directly on your phone, which you will not own and won't in all likelihood have any aithority to enumerate.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

You can find NHSX's guidance on vulnerability reporting for the app here:

* https://github.com/nhsx/COVID-19-app-Android-BETA/blob/master/SECURITY.md

In the event that you discover a serious, or not so serious security vulnerability with the NHSX contact tracing application, we would recommend that you report this via the proper channels.
